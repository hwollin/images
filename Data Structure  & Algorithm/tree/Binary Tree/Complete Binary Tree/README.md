**定义**：A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right. This definition ensures that the tree is as compact as possible.

**存储优势**：完全二叉树特别适合用数组来存储。

**应用**：完全二叉树常用于实现二叉堆，这是许多优先队列实现的基础，广泛用于任务调度、数据流中的最大/最小值查找等。
